DEVELOPMENT OF AN ART ANALYSER AUTOMATED MACHINE 

smARTS is an Open Source project funded by the EU-Horizon 2020 research and innovations programme and is hosted by the MECAMAT research group. smARTS aims low cost prototypes, free and open source software and hardware technology for mapping, analyse and monitoring materials in the field of heritage science.

Our machine is based in a Cartesian movement system and its goal is to do a high resolution scanning of cultural heritage material samples, in order to map materials decay processes and patterns, and monitoring conservation treatments.

The project has been focused in order to be easy to replicate and assemble. It has been built with accessible and low cost materials. Moreover, it has been designed considering the chance to adapt the main dimensions to the user necessities, which makes it useful for a large community.
